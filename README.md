# Python Burger Restaurant

By Kailynn


Worked on a team project to create a program in Python which represent a Burger Restaurant. Within the program we had to implement sections of code that asked for user input. Such as names, kind of burger, time of day and cost. Once the program was fully run, then it will give the output. The output was which were the top 3 most popular burger, hour with the most money made, and hour with the most people and the total amount made.
